CDCT with Pact workshop
==================
For those of you looking to gain some experience working with [Pact](http://docs.pact.io/), here are all the materials from a workshop I've created and delivered multiple times to good reviews. Feel free to use, share and adapt these materials as you see fit.

What do I need?
---
A Java 8 JDK and Maven. That's it.

What API is used for the exercises?
---
I'm using a custom API that's heavily inspired on the [Zippopotam.us](http://zippopotam.us) API.

Slides
---
The .pptx/ file in the root folder contains all slides from the workshop. Currently, I've only added the Dutch version of the slides, but an English version is on its way. Again, feel free to use, share and adapt them to fit your own requirements.

Comments? Saying thanks?
---
Feel free to file an issue here or send me an email at bas@ontestautomation.com.

I'd rather have you deliver the workshop instead...
---
Sure, I'd love to. Again, send me an email and I'll be happy to discuss options. In house or at your conference, I'm sure we can work something out.
